      	<div class='intro prose'><p> For every Himalayan summit climbed by a mountaineer, there is a so-called "second summit": an interview with Elizabeth Hawley, the keeper of the Himalayas. In 1960, the American-born journalist returned to Kathmandu, Nepal after first visiting on a round-the-world trip a year prior. She has never left. She started out working as a reporter for Reuters, and since then, she has become the world's premier authority on Himalayan mountaineering, the first to keep meticulous records on every peak and every mountaineer that has dared to attempt them. For those who claim to have made it to the top, Hawley will ask detailed questions about the expedition team, the route, what the summit looked like. From past photographs and decades of experience, Hawley can smell half-truths from those who didn't quite make it all the way.</p>

      	<p>In 1991, American Richard Salibury was planning an expedition to Annapurna IV and met Hawley when she interviewed him as the team's leader. A computer scientist from UMichigan, Salisbury was impressed by the exhaustive records she kept and suggested she publish them as a database. After countless hours of work by two Nepali data entry clerks, the two published the database in 2004 through a CD-ROM format, charging $70 per copy. In 2017, the Himalayan Database became a non-profit, allowing the database to be distributed online for free. Today, the database holds information about over 450 peaks and 9600 expeditions. It is a culmination of a life's work.

  <h2>The Peaks</h2>
	      		<p > Below are all of the peaks in the Himalayan Database. I wanted to visualize the height and location of each peak, and show each peak within the context of its mountain range. There are some notable exclusions, including eight-thousanders K2, Nanga Parbat, and Gasherbrum. Hawley chose to record peaks exclusively in the Nepalese Himalaya, which excludes peaks in neighboring China, Pakistan, and India.   </p></div>

          <p> Climbers must acquire permits. Everest permits can cost x amount of dollars. Source of revenue for Nepal. Nepal opened more peaks in year y and 2014 open for climbing, the government regulates it. There are x many unclimbed peaks. In 2014, a new peak was named after Elizabeth hawley. (aka pota north)

            Hawley thinks people aren't being creative with new routes

            At an international symposium for women who had summited Everest, Hawley was asked to speak due to her knowledge of climbing. McDonald writes, “Using example after example, she pointed out that women were not opening new routes or advancing the standards set by men…Her standards were high for men—and for women.”

      		<h2>Where the mountaineers come from</h2>
      		<p> Climbers come from all over the world to the Himalayas. The first expeditions were British. The first summit was a British expedition, but Hillary was from New Zealand and Norgay a Sherpa from Nepal. First Everest summit was in 1953 by Tenzing and Edmund.Mountaineers come from all over the world. Steady increase in commercialization. (one of the issues facing everest is the commercialization, there are no regulations for who can attain a permit (experience level, # of people per season) as long as you can pay for it. this had led to traffic on top of everest, leading to more risk and deaths, like in 1996.)No summits in 2014-2016 b/c of avalanche and earthquake</p>

      		<h2>Climbing season</h2>
          <p> Climbing season is May and Sept-oct. Why does everyone climb everest in May? comes down to snow, temperature,and wind. Before and after the monsoon season the winds are lowest. jet stream = western wind. Monsoon=weather is hot and wet, rains everyday. Window around end of May = perfect weather, interval of 4-5 days of stable weather = the window.

      		<h2>The best time to summit</h2>
      		<p> climbers typically leave in the middle of the night . Rob Hall said if you don't make it ti the south summit then you must turn around.last turnaround time = 2pm. Sherpas encourage climbers to turn around if they think you won't make it. 
          http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2017/08/22/update-young-sherpa-brought-to-u-s-before-amputation/ (client refuses to turn back) summiting later in the day=death. Because it gets dark, they have to bivouack in 8000+ death zone if they can't get to camp IV before nightfall</p>
