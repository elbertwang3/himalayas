      	<div class='intro prose'><p> For every Himalayan summit climbed by a mountaineer, there is a so-called "second summit": an interview with Elizabeth Hawley, the keeper of the Himalayas. In 1960, the American-born journalist returned to Kathmandu, Nepal after first visiting on a round-the-world trip a year prior. She has never left. She started out working as a mountaineering correspondent for Reuters, and since then, she has become the world's premier authority on Himalayan mountaineering, the first to keep meticulous records on every peak and every mountaineer that has dared to attempt them. For those who make it to the top, Hawley will ask detailed questions about the expedition team, the route, what the summit looked like, and more. From past photographs and decades of experience, Hawley can smell half-truths from those who didn't quite make it all the way.</p>

      	<p>In 1991, American Richard Salibury was planning an expedition to Annapurna IV and met Hawley when she interviewed him as the team's leader. A computer scientist from UMichigan, Salisbury was impressed by the exhaustive records she kept and suggested she publish them as a database. After countless hours of work by two Nepali data entry clerks, the two published the database in 2004 through a CD-ROM format. In 2017, the Himalayan Database became a non-profit, allowing the database to be distributed online for free. Today, the database holds information about over 450 peaks and 9600 expeditions. It is a culmination of a life's work.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Peaks</h2>
	      <p> Below are the peaks listed in the Himalayan Database. There are some notable exclusions, including eight-thousanders K2, Nanga Parbat, and Gasherbrum, among others. Hawley records peaks exclusively within the Nepalese Himalaya, which excludes peaks in neighboring China, Pakistan, and India. Of the 457 peaks in the database, 309 have been climbed, and 148 remain unclimbed. The first successful ascent listed in the database is Alexander Kellas' summit of Langpo (6965m). Kellas was a Scottish chemist and mountaineer, known for his pioneering studies on the effects of high altitude on the body. Thought to be impossible, he theorized that it was indeed possible to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen--a feat later accomplished by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler in 1978. In 1921, Kellas was invited to take part in the first reconnaissance expedition to Everest, but he unexpectedly died of a heart attack on his way to Base Camp. He was 53.</p>

          <p> The Nepalese government and the Ministry of Tourism regulates climbing of the peaks, and they have continuously opened new peaks for climbing throughout the years to boost tourism, a significant portion of the economy. The newest eight-thousander, Yalung Kang West, opened in 2014. </p>

          <p>When the government opened Pota Himal North for climbing in 2014, they named it Peak Hawley. When Hawley found out, she thought it was a joke at first, insisting that mountains should not be named after people. "Nepalis looked to the Himalaya as the home of the Gods, and you don't bother the Gods in their home," she explains.  </p>

          <h2>All routes lead to Everest</h2>
          <p> Of the more than 70,000 individual trips to the Himalayas, nearly 20,000 of those have been to Everest. Climbing Everest has become big business since the 1990s, with climbers paying upwards of $60,000 to be guided to the summit by a trekking agency. These commercial expeditions take either the South Col-Southeast Ridge route or North Col-Northeast Ridge route, the two routes which make up the lion's share of Everest summits. Everest's first summiters Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay established the southern route in 1953, and a Chinese expedition pioneered the northern route in 1960. </p>

           <p>Everest consists of three faces: the Southwest Face, the North Face, and the East (Kangshung Face). With a longer approach and hanging glaciers on the upper face, the East Face is the most dangerous route to ascend, with no ascents until an American expedition in 1983 successfully tackled it. Most other routes also remain remote and difficult to climb, including the steep and narrow Hornbein Couloir. In 1963, Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld separated from team members climbing the tradition southern route to forge a new route, navigating the Western Cwm to the West Ridge and through the North Face. Few have attempted to repeat this route, let alone successfully climb it. </p>

      		<h2>65 Years of Everest Summits</h2>
      		<p> Climbers have come from all over the world to the Himalayas. The first expeditions were British-led, including the 1924 expedition resulting in the the disappearance of George Mallory. The first successful expedition in 1953 was also British-sponsored, but first summiters Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were from New Zealand and Nepal. Since the 90s, there has been a steady increase in guided commercial expeditions. All climbers must acquire permits in order to climb, and a permit for Everest is fixed at $11,000 per climber. With insurance, gear, and a guiding agency, the cost can easily run over $60,000, with no guarantee to the summit.</p>  

          <p> Climbing guides take clients up in "siege style," which involves fixing rope and setting up camps along the mountain, supported by a team of Sherpa guides and porters. It is a slow, methodical march up to the peak this way. In Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air</i>, which chronicles the 1996 Everest disaster, he described a sherpa "hauling [New York socialite Sandy Hill Pittman] up the slope like a horse pulling a plow," implying that she was ostensibly carried up to the peak. For clients who can afford the hefty price tag, the sheer amount of manpower and resources of siege style can take lesser experienced climbers to the top.

            Detractors to the commercialization of Everest lament that half the people on Everest don't belong on the mountain. These more experienced mountaineers climb in "alpine style," the purest form of mountaineering--no fixed ropes, no porters, no supplemental oxygen. These climbers are self-sufficient, carrying all the food, shelter, and equipment they need on their own, minimizing the weight on their backs. Alpine style results in faster climbs but comes with its own set of risks, without the support of a camp to return to. </p>

          <p> The Nepali government has tried to regulate who can climb Everest, but the rules have not been enforced. experience level, bu there are too many people on the summit, leading to traffic, more risk and deaths.No summits in 2014-2016 b/c of avalanche and earthquake</p>
          <h2>Occupations</h2>
          <p> First Everest summit was in 1953 by Tenzing and Edmund. Mountaineers come from all over the world. Steady increase in commercialization. No summits in 2014-2016 b/c of avalanche and earthquake</p>

      		<h2>Climbing season</h2>
          <p> Climbing season is May and Sept-oct. Why does everyone climb everest in May? comes down to snow, temperature,and wind. Before and after the monsoon season the winds are lowest. jet stream = western wind. Monsoon=weather is hot and wet, rains everyday. Window around end of May = perfect weather, interval of 4-5 days of stable weather = the window.

      		<h2>The best time to summit</h2>
      		<p> climbers typically leave in the middle of the night . Rob Hall said if you don't make it ti the south summit then you must turn around.last turnaround time = 2pm. Sherpas encourage climbers to turn around if they think you won't make it. 
          http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2017/08/22/update-young-sherpa-brought-to-u-s-before-amputation/ (client refuses to turn back) summiting later in the day=death. Because it gets dark, they have to bivouack in 8000+ death zone if they can't get to camp IV before nightfall</p>
