          <p> For every Himalayan summit climbed by a mountaineer, there is a so-called "second summit": an interview with Elizabeth Hawley, the keeper of the Himalayas. In 1960, the American-born journalist returned to Kathmandu, Nepal after first visiting on a round-the-world trip a year prior. She has never left. She started out working as a mountaineering correspondent for Reuters, and since then, she has become the world's premier authority on Himalayan mountaineering, the first to keep meticulous records on every peak and every mountaineer that has dared attempt them. For those who make it to the top, Hawley will ask detailed questions about the expedition team, the route, what the summit looked like, and more. From photographs and decades of experience, Hawley can smell half-truths from those who didn't quite make it all the way.</p>

      	 <p>In 1991, American Richard Salibury was planning an expedition to Annapurna IV and met Hawley when she interviewed him as the team's leader. A computer scientist from UMichigan, Salisbury was impressed by the exhaustive records she kept and suggested she publish them as a database. After countless hours of work by two Nepali data entry clerks, the two published the database in 2004 in a CD-ROM format. In 2017, the Himalayan Database became a non-profit, allowing the database to be distributed online for free. Today, the database holds information about over 450 peaks and 9600 expeditions. It is a culmination of a life's work.
          </p>
        
          <h2>The Peaks</h2>
	       <p> There are currently 457 peaks listed in the database, of which 309 have been climbed and 148 remain unclimbed. There are some notable ommissions, including eight-thousanders K2, Nanga Parbat, and Gasherbrum, among others. Hawley chose to record peaks exclusively within the Nepalese Himalaya, which excludes peaks in neighboring China, Pakistan, and India.</p>

          <p> The Nepalese government and the Ministry of Tourism regulates climbing of the peaks, and they have continuously opened new peaks for climbing throughout the years to boost tourism, a significant portion of their economy. The newest eight-thousander, Yalung Kang West, opened in 2014. </p>

          <p>When the government opened Pota Himal North for climbing in 2014, they named the peak after Hawley. When she found out, she thought it was a joke at first, insisting that mountains should not be named after people. "Nepalis looked to the Himalaya as the home of the Gods, and you don't bother the Gods in their home," she explained.  </p>

          <p> The first successful ascent of any peak listed in the database is Alexander Kellas' summit of Langpo (6965m). Kellas was a Scottish mountaineer and chemist, known for his pioneering studies on the effects of high altitude on the body. He theorized that it was possible to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen--thought to be impossible at the time. Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler proved him correct in 1978, becoming the first to summit Everest without oxygen. In 1921, Kellas was invited to take part in the British reconnaissance expedition to Everest, but he unexpectedly died of a heart attack on his way to Base Camp. He was 53.</p>
          <h2>All routes lead to Everest</h2>
          <p> Of the more than 70,000 individual trips to the Himalayas, nearly 20,000 of those have been to Everest. Climbing Everest has become big business since the 1990s, with climbers paying upwards of $60,000 to be guided to the summit by a trekking agency. These commercial expeditions take either the South Col-Southeast Ridge route or North Col-Northeast Ridge route, which make up over 90% of all Everest summits. Everest's first summiters Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay established the southern route in 1953, and a Chinese expedition pioneered the northern route in 1960. </p>

           <p>Everest consists of three faces: the Southwest Face, the North Face, and the East (Kangshung Face). With a longer approach and hanging glaciers on the upper face, the East Face is the most dangerous route to ascend, with no ascents until an American expedition successfully tackled it in 1983. Most other routes also remain remote and difficult to climb, including the steep and narrow Hornbein Couloir. In 1963, Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld separated from team members climbing the tradition southern route to forge a new path, navigating the Western Cwm to the West Ridge through the North Face. Few have attempted to repeat this route, let alone have successfully climbed it. </p>
          <p> 

      		<h2>65 Years of Everest Summits</h2>
      		<p>  The first reconnaissance missions to Everest were British-led, including the 1924 expedition resulting in the the disappearance of George Mallory. The first successful expedition in 1953 was also British-sponsored (even though summiters Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were from New Zealand and Nepal). Since the 90s, there has been a boom in guided commercial expeditions, and climbers now come from all over the globe. Now that Nepal regulates climbing of its peaks, all climbers must acquire permits, and a permit for Everest is fixed at $11,000 per climber. With insurance, gear, and a guiding agency, the cost can easily run over $60,000, with no guarantee to the summit.</p>  

          <p> Sherpas are an essential part of these commercial expeditions, serving as mountain guides, responsible for preparing the route with ladders and rope, and also as porters, carrying food, oxygen, and equipment for themselves and for clients. Guides take clients up in "siege style," which involves fixing rope and setting up camps stocked with food and gear along the mountain. It is a slow, methodical march up to the peak this way. In Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air</i>, which chronicles the 1996 Everest disaster, he describes a sherpa hauling New York socialite Sandy Hill Pittman "up the slope like a horse pulling a plow," ostensibly carrying her up to the peak. For clients who can afford the hefty price tag, the sheer amount of manpower and resources of siege style allows even lesser experienced climbers to reach the top.

          <p> In 2014 and 2015, avalanches killed several Sherpa guides who were fixing rope and ladders in April for the upcoming May climbing season. As a mark of respect for the victims, Everest was closed for the rest of the season in both years. There were no summits in 2015. In a country where the average yearly income is $700, Sherpas can make up to $5000 in a single climbing season, yet the risks and costs that come with the job are immeasurable. </p>

            Detractors to the commercialization of Everest lament that half the climbers on Everest don't even belong on the mountain, and the exorbitant amount of climbers--especially slower inexperienced ones--cause traffic at high altitude, multiplying the risks for altitude-related illnesses and deaths. Thousands of expeditions have also left oxygen canisters, climbing gear, and human waste in their wake, polluting the once-sacred mountain. </p>

            <p> The Nepalese government has tried to minimize the risks and negative side effects that have come with commercialization, introducing a rule that allows only climbers who have scaled a peak over 6500m to obtain a permit for Everest. They have also tried to implement policies to reduce wait times and waste, requiring ladders at the Hillary Step and dual ropes along the peak (one up, one down), as well as requiring climbers to bring down 8kg of trash. They have had little success implementing these policies, with no way to enforce them.</p>

             <!--<p>These more experienced mountaineers climb in "alpine style," the purest form of mountaineering--no fixed ropes, no porters, no supplemental oxygen. These climbers are self-sufficient, carrying all the food, shelter, and equipment they need on their own, minimizing the weight on their backs. Alpine style results in faster climbs but comes with its own set of risks, without the support of a camp to return to. </p>-->
            <h2> Occupations</h2>
            <p> Being able to climb Everest is an indicator of a certain class privilege, as expensive as guiding agencies are. The most expensive agencies can cost over $100,000, offering perks like a high guide to climber ratio, pre-acclimatization in a personal altitude tent at home, unlimited oxygen, and multiple attempts. It's no surprise, then, that outside of alpine guide, some of the most popular occupations listed in the database are physician, engineer, and lawyer--all professions able to afford such luxuries. </p>

          <p> Still, others from more humble backgrounds also dream about Everest. Doug Hansen, a member of the Adventure Consultants' 1996 Everest expedition, was a worker for the US Postal Service, and he worked night shifts and side construction jobs to save up for the trip. He had been 300 feet short of the summit in 1995 and forced to turn back due to dangerous conditions. He was back for 1996. It was already past 2:00 in the afternoon, the generally accepted latest time to summit, but this time he didn't turn back. He summited at almost 4:00, exhausted and with few hours of sunlight left to descend. He didn't make it all the way down. Perhaps it was in the back of his mind it was his last shot, that he wouldn't have been able to afford another trip.</p> 

          <h2>The best time to summit</h2>
          <p> From Camp 4 (South Col), climbers leave in the middle of the night to make a push for the summit, which typically takes 8-12 hours. Successful climbers usually reach the summit early in the morning, leaving more than enough time to descend before nightfall. Those who don't survive the descent summit much later in the day. The descent to Camp 4 takes 4-8 hours, and if they are unable to reach Camp 4 before dark, they are in trouble. They will stuck in the death zone (above 8000m).  </p>

          In 2017, Dawa Sange Sherpa was guiding his client Pakistani Abdul Jabbar Bhatti from the South Summit (8749m) in a final push to the summit (8848m) when the weather took a turn for the worse. Sange encouraged his client to turn back, but Bhatti refused, citing how much he had paid for the trip. The two summited at 3:00 pm. On the descent, sapped of energy, they both started to lose consciousness and began to fall asleep. They both would have died had they not been rescued by Sherpas who found them. Sange had all of his fingers severely frostbitten, and stands to lose them to amputation.</p>
          <p> Sherpas are sometimes powerless against the wills of clients, whose decision-making abilities are compromised due to the lack of oxygen at high altitude. Inexperienced climbers cannot determine when to turn back and when to push forward, putting their own lives and their guides' lives at risk. </p>

          <h2>Climbing season</h2>
          <p> Climbing season is May and Sept-oct. Why does everyone climb everest in May? comes down to snow, temperature,and wind. Before and after the monsoon season the winds are lowest. jet stream = western wind. Monsoon=weather is hot and wet, rains everyday. Window around end of May = perfect weather, interval of 4-5 days of stable weather = the window.
